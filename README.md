# Swire Coca Cola Capstone Project
This is a group project that I completed for my final Capstone with 3 other colleagues. Swire Coca Cola (SCCU) is a bottling company that has partnered with the Coca-Cola Company to manufacture Coke and distribute it. Coca-Cola produces a unique concentrate which Swire mixes with water and sweetners to produce the actual drink. Afterwards, Swire will deliver the finished product to customers in the United States.

## Business Problem

This project will mainly focus on SCCU's logistics within their delivery operations. SCCU has two delivery methods:

- Red Trucks, which are directly controlled by Swire and used for direct deliveries and are ideal for high-volume customers. This enables SCCU to maintain direct relationship with them. 
- Alternate Route to Market (ARTM) - White Trucks, are operated by third-party companies, resulting in less direct contact between Swire and the customer. These trucks are better suited for customers with lower volume needs.

SCCU is seeking a **cost-efficient** strategy to optimize logistics to drive operational efficiencies and increases revenue. To achieve this, SCCU is currently using a threshold of **400** gallons to determine if a customer should be on Red Trucks or sent to an ARTM. Customers who **annually order more** than 400 gallons should remain on the Red Trucks while the rest of the customers should be placed on White Trucks. Misclassification with the existing threshold risks missed opportunities for revenue growth and weakens customer relationships by miscalssifying customers who have the potential to grow.

### Project Objectives
- Leverage advanced analytics to ensure that high-growth accounts remain on direct delivery routes. This will optimize **cost-efficiency** by switching low-growth accounts to ARTM. Additionally, explore what characteristics enable a customer to grow beyond 400 gallons.
  
- The analysis will focus on two key customer segments requested by SCCU:
  - Local Market Partners (fountain-only buyers): Customers who purchase only fountain drinks, with no CO2, cans, or bottles.
  - All Customers: The broader customer base, including all buyers of CO2, cans, bottles, and fountain drinks, regardless of partnership status.
 
- SCCU has also requested that alternative considerations for the threshold be considered such as 100 gallons, etc for determining if a customer should be on the Red Truck or White Truck.

## Problem Solution

Our group's solution to the project was the following: 

### 1. Target "Mid-Volume" Customers
**Focus Segment:** 300-449 gallon/year customers

**Growth Potential:** 22% higher conversion rate than 450+ gallon cohort

**Tactics:**
  - Personalized replenishment plans via MY_COKE360 portal
  - Dynamic discounting for incremental volume commitments

### 2. Optimize Partnership Channels
**High-Impact Channels:**
- Sales Rep Outreach : 38% conversion lift with dedicated account managers
- EDI Integration : 27% faster order fulfillment for chain stores
- MY_COKE360 : 41% customer retention in pilot markets

### 3. Geographic Focus
**High-Priority States:**
  - MA
  - KS
  - KY
  - MD
These 5 states comprise 62% of high-density customers

## Business Value

The Business Value of this solution is that it enables Swire to better accurately identify which customers have the potential to exceed the threshold. For instance, focusing on "Mid-Volume" customers who consume 300-449 gallon/year is a more targetd approach. This more targeted approach will enable Swire to better identify customers who could exceed th threshold while spending less resouces. This in turn helps reduce their costs and improves logistic efficency as well.
